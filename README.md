# coffee_state_machine [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/spearwolf/coffee_state_machine.png "Build Status")](http://travis-ci.org/spearwolf/coffee_state_machine)

a _finite state machine_ made in and for [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (javascript).

_please note that this software is still at an_ __experimental stage__.



### some brief, high-level features include:

*  defining state machines on any javascript object or class

*  state-driven instance behavior (methods and attributes)

*  flexible DSL (based around _states_, _events_ and _transitions_) to define state machines

*  very high code-coverage using the [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) test framework

*  written in 100% [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
